# Planet Breeding 101

You're someone who's recently purchased an Apeiron Planet and is interested in starting to breed more Planets. But how should you get started? What are the dos and donts? This page, put together under the direction of LoreKeeper - Foonie Magus CEO and creative mind behind Apeiron - has you covered.

First and foremost, you want to check out your elemental distribution. In particular, you’re looking for matching elements. For instance, if you are very lucky and manage to get two Pure or Duo-element Planets of the same type — two Tempest Planets (Pure Air), for example — you can just go ahead and produce _another_ Tempest world, no problem. Or if you got two Dune (Fire + Air) Planets, you could make another powerful Duo element Dune world. Neat!

What you _don’t_ want to do is take elements of different types and mix them together. Let’s say you have a Dune (Fire + Air) and breed it with an Archipelago (Water + Earth) Planet. In this case, you’re starting with two duo-element worlds, but the offspring is very likely to be a 4-element mix, a Normal planet, which will be less powerful for competitive play. Don’t crossbreed different elements!

On top of that, please note as well that it is generally disadvantageous to breed, say, a duo-element world with a four-element mix. The offspring will likely be a four-element world, and you want to try to concentrate distributions in your offspring Planets rather than diluting them.

By breeding together worlds of similar elemental distributions, you’ll be able to work on tweaking the skills for your Avatar’s combat deck (more on that below) as well as gradually refine and concentrate your elements for the offspring, giving you access to more powerful skills. It’s going to take a lot of time to refine elemental distributions, but basically you just want to be on the lookout for planets of the same tier and same elemental distributions.

**BREEDER TIP #1** — Search for same elemental distributions and tiers for potential breeding on the market place. Don’t crossbreed different elements, and don’t breed higher rarity tier planets with lower tiers!

The next thing you want to make a note of is the Avatar class. Together with your elemental type, the class will determine the skills for your combat deck using that Avatar. If you have multiple Avatars with the same class, it’s beneficial to you, because you can build your deck to be what you want it to be.

How does that work? Let’s say you have two Fury Avatars. They each have 3 Class Skills (C-Skils), but Fury Avatar 1 (we’ll call him Bob) has only 1 C-Skill you like, while Fury Avatar 2 (we’ll call her Emma) has 2 C-Skills you like. In this case, you could consider breeding Bob’s Planet with Emma’s Planet — the resulting Planet will 100% have the Fury class, and will have some combination of Bob and Emma’s skills — hopefully, it’ll have just the three you’re looking for.

**BREEDER TIP #2**- Breeding Planets with the same Avatar class will help to refine your skillset for your combat deck.

By breeding together Planets of similar elements and classes, you’ll be actively building your combat deck to make a stronger Avatar, one that is ready and prepped for competitive play when the game launches, and all of the prizes and glory that it entails. On top of that, if you feel like you have a great deck, you can consider mass reproducing it and selling your extras on the marketplace!

We should mention that you don’t necessarily need to focus on breeding a mono-element world to get the highest-tier skills. Maybe you have two four-element Normal planets and it seems like it’s going to take forever to breed them into a mono-element. The thing is, _every elemental type_, including Normal, has its own biomes which will produce different gameplay with unique Relic NFTs to collect, each with their own advantages. In fact, you may want to consider collecting one of every planet type, just to have access to all of these different Relics and gameplay experiences.

Notably, the four element worlds are also more forgiving in terms of gameplay towards newer players, making them a better entry point for newbies into Apeiron. If you aren’t interested in competitive play, building up a collection of different four-mixes to be able to provide to new players on launch could be a viable strategy.

**BREEDER TIP #3**- For competitive entrepreneurs: Amass planets with the same elemental distribution and Avatar class, breed until you complete a “viable deck”, then seek to reproduce this en masse!!

**MASS BREEDER TIP**- Gather the four element planets and breed your hearts out! These are colorful, balanced worlds for newbies with a little bit of everything, perfect to experience Apeiron’s fun gameplay.
