# Celestial Conjunction: Planet Breeding

**Planet Breeding:** Should a player acquire more than one Planet through the galactic NFT marketplace, they will be able to perform what is called a Celestial Conjunction. A Celestial Conjunction takes the Planetary Elemental Distribution and Traits of both parent Planets - their spiritual essence - and generates a new one. By repeating the process of Celestial Conjunction, players will be able to “breed” their own utopias. These new planets will be their own unique NFTs which can be either kept for play or sold on the marketplace. &#x20;

* **Elemental Distribution:** Planets will have 100 elemental points distributed among the four traditional elements: Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. This distribution forms the basic attributes of a Planet, not only does it affect the Planet’s appearance, it also affects the types of objects the player and Doods can create. Furthermore, a more concentrated elemental distribution will give access to more powerful skills and miracles.&#x20;
* **Planetary Traits:** In addition to its elements,  Planet can obtain traits though engaging with the Planet simulation gameplay, with some traits being rarer than others. While many traits will have a direct impact on gameplay, some are purely cosmetic.
* Through Celestial Conjunctions, the player will be able to concentrate their elemental attributes to make incredible **Primal Planets** - a Primal Fire Planet, for example, will have its whole surface wreathed in flames. Players will be able to unlock special rewards for creating Primal Planets and other types of unique worlds.&#x20;

**Breeding Requirements:** First, you’ll need to own 2 planets. Second, you’ll need to pay a certain amount of Apeiros (APRS) and Anima (ANIMA), our governance token and play-to-earn token, respectively. Once you have paid the fee and selected the two planets from your collection, then the ritual can commence.

* The amount of APRS needed for each ritual will be static, but the amount of ANIMA will go up as you use the planets more times. Ultimately, each planet can only be used to produce 3 additional planets. After that, the planet cannot be used in Celestial Conjunction.

**Primeval Legacy Traits for Master Breeding:** What does a Primeval Legacy Trait do? Essentially, when a Primeval Legacy activates, it will guarantee that your new planet does not fall below a certain minimum threshold for the dominant element. For example, let’s imagine you have two planets, an Earth Planet and a Fire Planet. The Fire Planet has the “Primeval Legacy: Pillar of Flames, which has an associated minimum threshold of 80% for the Fire element. When you make your new planet through a Celestial Conjunction ritual, then, the new planet will have a guaranteed at least 80% Fire element. Check out the table below:

![Planet Trait table and effects on breeding.](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)

Basically, whichever Trait value is bigger will be the one to activate. Looking at the Table above, let’s imagine I have one planet with the Primeval Legacy: Dunes and one with the Primeval Legacy: Pillar of Flames. In this case, since 80 > 55, the Pillar of Flames will be the one to activate, and my new planet will have 80% Fire.

The new planet will have a 10% chance to inherit the trait for EACH parent AND grandparent that shares the same trait, up to a maximum of 60% (both parents and 4 grandparents). Primeval Legacy helps players have some control over the planet breeding process.

**Planet Age:** Planet age is important for one reason: it unlocks more Relic slots. Relic slots allow players to insert Relic NFTs — powerful items or characters found across the godiverse — and use them for play for that particular planet. The older the planet, the more Relic slots it has! The more Relics, the more potential power you can boost into that planet.

When a planet is born, its age is set to 0, and it will increase by 1 every day. Once it reaches a certain age — shown in the table below — it will advance to the next age group, unlocking more relic slots. The earlier you breed, the better — as the more time passes, the older and more powerful the planet!

You may not want to necessarily wait before your planet reaches the next age tier. In this case, the Sanctuary section of the Marketplace offers ways for you to speed up the aging process. Notably, through the rite known as Chronomerging, you can sacrifice one planet and automatically add its age to another’s.

Additionally, aging can be sped up by positioning a planet next to a Star. More on that in the section on Stars below.

**Avatar Cosmetics:** Avatar Cosmetics are separated among 3 parameters:  Weapon, Head and Body. Head and Body are inter-inheritable between elements AND classes, so whatever the parent planets have, you can expect the child to likely pick up! The Weapon, on the other hand, is bound to class, so that will follow whatever class the child has. There are thousands of potential combinations, making each Avatar unique!
