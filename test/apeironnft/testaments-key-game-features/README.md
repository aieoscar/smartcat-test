# Testaments: Key Game Features

Apeironâ€™s gameplay is built upon three pillars:

1. Roguelite
2. God-Game Simulation
3. Player Ownership

This section of the whitepaper will address the different pillars and how they interact. Please note that as our game is currently in development, the information contained in this section is subject to change. We will be continually updating the different sections as we build up the godiverse.
