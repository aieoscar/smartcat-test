# Guild Wars: Competitive PvE

Starting with the Battle Demo Season 1, Apeiron hosts its own Guild Wars tournaments. These are Guild v Guild events where players sign up to represent a guild and then compete for honors. In season 1, the competition was in speedrunning, with the fastest times winning the preliminary competition.&#x20;

The Season 2 Guild Wars leaderboard will be based on our "Infinity Run" version of the Battle Demo, where players can continue to loop the 3 Dungeon Depths infinitely, with the game getting progressively harder with each loop. How far will players be able to go? We'll find out!&#x20;

If you're interested in getting involved in Apeiron competitively, consider joining the Season 2 Guild Wars by finding a guild to represent and getting involved in the community.&#x20;

Check out this amazing speedrun!&#x20;
