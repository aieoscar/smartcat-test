# Avatars

Avatars are manifestations of a Planet's power, made real through your divinity. In the dungeon, your Avatar represents _you_. You control your Avatar directly, moving it around the battlefield, firing off auto-attacks and skills. You're the leader of what will become a merry band of adventuring Dood Apostles. You have the most powerful, impactful skills, but are also the most vulnerable member of the team, since if your Avatar falls in battle, your dungeon run is over.&#x20;

Your Avatar's appearance - and also their boon, a powerful passive ability - depends first and foremost on which Planet type the Avatar comes from.&#x20;

Your Avatars appearance and combat capabilities also depend on which class your Avatar is. There are three Avatar classes: The Fury, The Wisdom, and The Fate.&#x20;

The Fury is your classic frontlining combat class, ready to get into the scrap and fight it out. The Wisdom is a backline caster, slinging spells and taking names. And The Fate is the ultimate commander, manipulating the battlefield until victory is all but assured.

## Avatar Skills

Please note that all of the Skill/Perk/Boon names below are a work-in-progress, and subject to change.

### Elemental Archetypes

Each Avatar can draw from Skills from the four elemental archetypes, each of which has its own strategic strengths and weaknesses.&#x20;

1. **Earth**\
   Earth Element is a natural defender, having skills to boost health and defence, while applying shields to its ally. It also has aggressive skills to disable enemies by stunning and rooting them, with utility spells to spawn forests for some interesting battle dynamics.\
   Avatars with predominantly Earth skills might look to complement their innate tankiness and crowd control abilities (CC) by bringing Apostles that need some protection but have high damage potential — the Mage or the Summoner, for example. OR you could go in the other direction and bring some Warriors and Guardians for a team that is just extremely hard to break down.
2. **Water**\
   Water Element excels in magical power. With substantial cooldown reduction and versatile magical skills, it offers both sustainable damage to enemies and support to allies.\
   Avatars with predominantly Water skills offer a lot of different deckbuilding possibilities, given that they can either act as supports for an aggressively slanted frontline of Knights, Rogues, and Dragoons, or as the primary damage dealer protected by Guardians, Knights, and Warriors. Conversely, you could utilize the cooldown reduction and bring along some Shamans and Bards to start spamming powerful skills at a higher rate.
3. **Fire**\
   Fire Element is raging and destructive. With a collection of AOE damaging skills, enemies turn into ashes in a glimpse, even if it sometimes means sacrificing allies…\
   Avatars with predominantly Fire skills will certainly bring the pain to the opponent, but at what cost? You could offset the friendly-fire AoE damage by bringing Priests and Guardians to heal and survive through the onslaught. On the other hand, you could lean into the danger and bring along some Berserkers, who thrive on low health, for a high risk, high reward strategy!
4. **Air**\
   Air Element pursues speed. Faster movement, faster attack, faster to stampede the enemies. While it is too fast for the opponent to respond, the controller also has to be quick enough to handle all of the game actions.\
   Avatars with predominantly Air skills are fast moving but will require good micro and targeting of abilities to have their maximum effect on the battlefield. These skills are more challenging for players to master, but will reward those who spend the time to learn them. Given that players will be spending their time during battle maneuvering their Avatar, they may wish to select easier to use Apostles, such as the Warrior or the Hunter, who can mostly take care of themselves.

### **Boons**

**Boons** are special passives and energized abilities (passives are always active, energized will activate under certain conditions, usually related to taking or dealing a certain amount of damage) that offer powerful effects for you to build around. Each of the passive Boons are linked with a Planet type, while the energized Boons are defined by the Avatar’s class. Here are some examples of passive Boons for different planet types:

* **Oasis — Lifestealing Water** **—** The Avatar has 25% Vamp, and its basic attacks ignore 25% of the target's DEF.
* **Delta — River Run** — After casting an Avatar Skill, the Avatar's next movement within a certain range executes in the form of a Blink.
* **Leviathan — Crushing Blows**— The Avatar deals x% increased damage to immobilized (CC'd) targets.

### **Perks**

**Perks** are another set of passives — but rather than being unlocked automatically, these are unlocked by investing elemental points. Elemental points are gained through leveling up your Avatar, and are spent on unlocking and improving different perks — up to 20 elemental points can be spent upgrading the effects of each perk. Perks are divided between the four elemental skill trees of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. Perks are pretty much straight upside - they just make your Avatar stronger! Below are some examples of different tiers of Perks from the different elemental trees:&#x20;

* **Ignited Savagery** **(Fire Perk Level 2)** — The Avatar’s Skills ignore a % of enemies’ defense and resistance.
* **Burning Fury (Fire Perk Level 4)** — The Avatar gains a stack of Burning Fury every 30 seconds, stacking up to 10 times. Each stack grants the Avatar a % of their ATK as a bonus.
* **Blazing Pride** **(Fire Perk Level 6)** — Discard actions now cost an amount of the Avatar’s flat HP rather than Mana.

### **Skills**

**Skills** are unlocked in a similar fashion to Perks. Every 20 points a new tier within an elemental tree will unlock, and each tier will come with more Skill cards for the player to choose from to add to their deck. There will be four tiers.

Additionally, Skill cards are linked to both element and class. There will also be special skills unlocked through reaching certain alignment levels (between good and evil), but we’ll have more information on Alignment Skill cards at a later date.

In contrast to Apostle Skills, Avatar Skills are significantly more powerful and impactful as befits a god's divine might!&#x20;

* **Unyielding Rock — Earth Tier 1 Skill/The Fury** — Creates an immovable rock at the target location for 5 seconds, knocking back all units directly from it to a location 1 unit from its center on-cast, dealing \[x]\(+50%INT) magic damage to all enemies hit, while slowing them by 40%.
* **Snowball of DOOM — Water Tier 1 Skill/The Fate** — Throws a snowball to the target enemy, dealing \[x] physical damage. The snowball then falls near the target after 1 second, where it remains for up to 4 seconds. Upon retrieving the snowball, the Avatar summons a Snow Thrall Apostle, while also granting the Avatar a shield equivalent to 20% of the Avatar’s max HP for 3 seconds. If the snowball kills the target, it bounces back to the top of your deck.
* **Nightmarish Bubble — Water Tier 2 Skill/The Wisdom —** Shoots a nightmarish bubble in the target direction that deals x magic damage to the first enemy hit, fearing and slowing them by 65% for 2 seconds.
* **Rising Sun Slash — Fire Tier 1 Skill/The Fury** — Slashes the area around the caster, dealing \[x] magic damage to enemies within, then jumps to the target location, and deals the same amount of damage to enemies hit on impact and slowing them by 60%.
* **Gust of Wind Dance — Air Tier 1 Skill/The Wisdom** — Dashes to an allied Apostle, gaining ghosted (ignores unit collision), while granting 20% bonus movement speed and a shield equivalent to \[x]\(+80%INT) to the target and itself upon arrival for 3 seconds.
