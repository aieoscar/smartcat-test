As the player builds up their worlds and develops a team of Avatars, each with their own powerful Combat Decks and supporting Apostles, they can consider joining an **Alliance**. An Alliance will allow them to join forces with other dedicated Godlings to tackle endgame content such as World Boss raids. They will want to do so, since defeating these World Bosses will unlock new **Seasonal Content.** Each season will come with the release of a new Mythological Galaxy. After defeating the Guardian World Boss raid, the content will be unlocked for everyone: this will include new Skill Cards, Apostles, Artifacts, and Worlds to explore!&#x20;

In addition to raiding, Alliances will also support players to join epic GvG battles - grand skirmishes with hundreds of players fighting off against each other in a huge and chaotic melee where only one side can come out standing!
