# Apostles

Most Doods live carefree hedonistic lives, but there are some who - inspired or saved by your divine power - hear the call to adventure. These are the Dood **Apostles**. Apostles will join you in battle and add their skills to your Combat Deck.&#x20;

* Apostles have different stats, classes, weapons, special body parts, and skills for a total of 0.3 billion unique combinations. The 12 Apostle classes are: Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Bard, Hunter, Priest, Summoner, Dragoon, Knight, Berserker, Shaman, and Guardian.
* Each Apostle has an associated deck of Skill Cards which will supplement your Avatar's Combat Deck. Bring different combinations of Apostles together with your Avatar to see what works most effectively in battle!&#x20;
* Apostles will drop randomly as battle rewards during the dungeon run. You can combine Apostles to upgrade their individual skills.
* Each Apostle has an Individual Variable (IV). IVs can range from 1-100. The higher the IV, the better the Apostle’s stats - everything from health to attack to defense.

Apostles are lost upon Armageddon, but can be converted into Relic NFTs using Apeiros, our governance token, and then traded on the marketplace.

## Apostle Skills

Each Apostle will come with a set of Skills derived from its class. There are 12 Apostle classes, and each class has a Skill Card pool of 8 unique skills. When you obtain an Apostle, it will come with 3 random skills from its class’ pool, which you can then add to your 15-card battle deck by bringing along that Apostle into battle. Each of the classes serves slightly different functionalities…

This table should give you a rough idea! Besides their Skills, Apostles also have their own innate abilities that will trigger when an Apostle is energized (having received and dealt a certain amount of damage).

Once in battle, you won’t control your Apostles directly, instead giving orders through using their Skills. When not using Skills, your Apostles will walk forward across the battlefield until they come in range of an enemy unit, which they’ll then start to auto-attack.

Below you'll find some information about each of the 12 Apostles and their general characteristics. Please note that the Skill names below are a work-in-progress.

### **Warrior**
