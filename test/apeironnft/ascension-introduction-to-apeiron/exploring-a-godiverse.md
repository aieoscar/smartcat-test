# Exploring a Godiverse

![The Apeiron Godiverse](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)

Above is our Map of the Godiverse, the Apeiron universe. Please note that this is still in development, and so subject to change - but this gives you an idea of it!&#x20;

In the center, you can see the **Axis Mundi** — the Center of Creation — from where all the godiverse emerges. It is here that Cosmos looks out from her seat on the Empyrean Throne and plans her next move in the war against Chaos and his corrupting Taint.

Surrounding the Axis Mundi are **Mythological Galaxies**, 12 in total, representing different mythologies from around the world: Sumer, Kemet, Olympus, Yggdrasill, Aseudal, Opona, Chryse, Penglai, Brahma Vardha, Moztoc, and Amatsuguhara. You can see Amatsuguhara slightly to the lower right of the Axis Mundi. These Mythological Galaxies are ruled by Mythic Gods, some of whom are benevolent and kind, while others…not so much. On top of that, the Galaxies are defended (or sealed away?) by incredibly powerful Guardians, and it will be one of your tasks as a Godling to challenge these Guardians and unlock the riches and mysteries of the Mythological Galaxies for all to explore.

Besides Mythological Galaxies, there are also **Celestial Waygates** sent to the physical realm by the enigmatic High God of the spiritual Dirac Dimension, which offer portals to various gameplay functions inside of the Godiverse: &#x20;

**The Conduit** will serve up all the latest Apeiron-related announcements, news, and — eventually — streamers!&#x20;

For those with a more competitive streak, head over to the **Hourglass Coliseum** and climb your way up the ladder with your Avatar and Apostles and shoot for rank #1.&#x20;

**Quantum Stadium** — aka our eSports Stadium — will host our Guild vs Guild battles and eSports “finals” battles! Epic doesn’t even cover half of it.&#x20;

**The Manifold Paths of Dirac** is our endless dungeon mode. With battles to fight, items to collect, and special events to uncover — all of which will be randomized and fresh each time — you’ll always have something new to experience by exploring the Paths.

**The Meta-Void:** this paradoxical space of fulfilling emptiness will offer a space to chat with other Godlings and play a variety of fun mini-games together. &#x20;

Finally, we have the **Cliffs of Veritas**. We’re not quite ready to reveal what happens at the Cliffs yet! \
