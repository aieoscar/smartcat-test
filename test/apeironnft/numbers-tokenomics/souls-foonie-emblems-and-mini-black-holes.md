# Souls, Foonie Emblems, and Mini-Black Holes

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png>)

In light of market conditions, we pushed back the launch of our APRS governance token until Q4 2022. This presented us with a challenge, as we had previously defined Celestial Conjunction Planet breeding as requiring APRS. Therefore, in May 2022 we decided to launch our Mini-Black Hole (mBH) NFTs.&#x20;

Over the past few months, we have airdropped mBH to our most dedicated and passionate Planet holders and community members, giving them a premier opportunity to produce more Planets. mBH is also now traded openly on the secondary market. Looking forward, after our game launches, given the success of the token, we have decided that mBH will be used alongside ANIMA to conduct Celestial Conjunction, and be available for purchase with APRS.

In addition to mBH, in late June 2022 we launched our Foonie Emblem (FE) NFTs and the Soul system on Discord. We'll talk about FE first.&#x20;

FE serve as rewards for our asset holding community members who are here with us for the long haul. Given out during AMAs, game nights, and other community events, Foonie Emblems may be sold on the secondary market OR exchanged through the FE Discord Shop. We have a table here showing the Rewards and FE cost for the FE Shop in Season 2 of the Demo.

Souls, on the other hand, are rewarded to any community member just for being active on our Discord as a way of encouraging organic community engagement and growth. The Soul Shop has a ton of great rewards to earn, including game time, t-shirts, and even a dood plushie! Below you can find the Soul Shop - which itself can be found on our Discord - for Season 2 of the Demo.&#x20;
