# Gospel: Doodify the World

## What's in a Dood?

Doods are not just chubby herd like creatures that roam your Planets. Doods is a lifestyle, an attitude... Being a Dood means embracing a little silliness, a little craziness, a love for food and fun with a happy go lucky attitude. It is important to be doody about the silly little things in our lives!

### Building Bonds

One of our fundamental guiding philosophies is that games are built on the back of strong communities. We think back to our most memorable gaming experiences - chatting with guildmates in _World of Warcraft_, raiding in _Destiny_, or even just gathered in front of a TV playing some _Smash Bros_ - games are more fun when you can share them with others.&#x20;

We have been laying the groundwork for Apeiron's community with the development of our social media presence, including official Twitter and Telegram. But we want to draw special attention to our official Discord server: what started as a place for people to gather and ask questions about Apeiron has become something more than just a gaming server. It's become a place where people hang out, chill, and forge real, lasting relationships with each other.&#x20;

### Modeling the Future

Beyond that, our Discord server has also become an ad hoc testing ground for prototyping our ideas. For instance, the DADI (Dynamic Apeiron Disciple Initiative) began as a way to outreach and help us spread the word about our project, but has since morphed into a form of self-run community leadership that resembles a DAO, with multiple tiers of leadership and structured organization. Looking forward, we are excited to be able to bring some of these passionate community members with us when Apeiron officially launches and has its own DAO structures in place.&#x20;

### Join the Party

With daily and weekly events, channels for a wide variety of conversational topics, as well as many different language groups, we are proud of the Discord server we have grown over the past few months. If you haven't already, come and join us! There's always room for another dood in the godiverse.&#x20;
