# Doodaria

Doodaria is the nickname for our official doody Discord community centered around Apeiron and doods, but with a lot more to offer. We've got rewards to earn from essential in-game items to precious plushies and comfy cushions, as well as tons of cool people to meet, and plenty more besides!

This page will introduce you to some of the basics of Doodaria. Unlike the average Discord server, Doodaria is a **gamified** server, which means there's a few ins and outs that you'll want to know to set yourself up for success.&#x20;

### Getting Started

How to join our Discord Server
{% endembed %}

To begin, just chat! If you're not sure which channel, #general is a good place to begin, that's where most of our doods will meet, greet, and hang out. Note that #general is in English language, but if you want to speak in another language, we have plenty of communities with Apeiron fans from around the world, so make sure to check 'em out! &#x20;

Simply learning about the game and making friends will get you rewards in the form of a currency called **Souls**. Souls can be exchanged for all sorts of Apeiron goodies, from in-game items to a real-life dood plushie!&#x20;

### Engaging Events

So you've gotten your first few Souls and have been saving up for the plushie, but now you're interested in getting more involved in the community - what's the next step? Join one of our events, of course! We have four kinds of events:&#x20;

1. **Challenger** -  For gamers to compete FOR ULTIMATE GLORY AND HONOR in various casual games and the greatest NFT god game of all time, Apeiron.
2. **Partygoer** - For light hearted fun such as movie nights, karaoke nights, and doodcasts (like a podcast, but...actually it's exactly the same a podcast lol).
3. **Preacher** - For those who help us spread the word on social media (like and retweet, share and follow, tell your friends, family, acquitances, and whoever you meet on the streets).&#x20;
4. **Gobbler** - For degen collabs and giveaways (ALWAYS make sure to do your own research on any other projects and be careful!).

### Asking for Assets

So you like the cut of Doodaria's gib and you'd like to get in on the ground floor of Apeiron. Great! Consider getting one of our assets - in particular, a **Planet**, which will set you up for playing Apeiron with all sorts of bonuses, or a **Star**, which will give you PASSIVE RENTS. You don't even need to do anything! Just rent it out and make money. Wowzer!&#x20;

And If you own our Planets or Stars, you can also earn **Foonie Emblems** (FE), tradeable NFT tokens that can be used to exchange for powerful NFT resources to enhance your Planets, as well as various EXCLUSIVE merchandise. No one else can get it. Only you. Just you.&#x20;

### Leading from the Front

You've done all of the above and you want MORE. You want to be a community leader!&#x20;

First of all, that's great! We encourage community-run, grassroots leadership of Doodaria. On our server you'll see references to **DADIs** and **Wranglers**. You can think of DADIs as kind of like doods who have received our stamp of approval for their doodiness and who help us out on occasion with community events and the like.&#x20;

Then there are our Wranglers, who are not only our community mods, but also some of the most passionate and knowledgeable Apeiron fans. We're always interested in growing the space and learning together, so if you've got ideas about how to make Apeiron and Doodaria better, start down the road to DADI-hood and you might end up as a Wrangler one day too!&#x20;
