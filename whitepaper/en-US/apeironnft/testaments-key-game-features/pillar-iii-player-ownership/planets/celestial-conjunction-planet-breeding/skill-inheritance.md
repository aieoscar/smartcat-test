# Skill Inheritance

**Combat Skill Inheritance:** There are three Avatar classes — the Fury, the Wisdom, and the Fate. After Celestial Conjunction, a new planet will inherit its class from either parent. If both parents are of the same class, you’ll be guaranteed to get the same class for the child. If the parents are in different classes, then it’s a straight 50/50 on which class the child planet will get.&#x20;

Each Avatar comes with up to 5 innate skills — 3 card skills (C-Skills), which are class dependent, and 2 passive skills (P-Skills), which are element dependent.

As C-Skills are class dependent, these will come from the parents. Let’s take a few demonstrative examples to unpack how it works — presented below:

Please note that in the third case, since the child can only draw from one parent, it will also have a 25% chance to receive a “neutral” C-Skill. Neutral C-Skills are generic combat skills that give your Avatar the flexibility of a wide-range of abilities — however, these tend to be less powerful than their dedicated elemental counterparts — and so it will be up to you to figure out if you want to use them or not.

Additionally, there is a small chance that any C-Skill will “mutate” into an entirely new skill! You might find your new planet coming with a powerful ability\` you absolutely were not expecting — or, similarly, something that doesn’t fit your plans. It’s something you’ll have to adapt to as you work through your celestial conjunctions.
