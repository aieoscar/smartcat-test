This page goes over the process of deckbuilding. In Apeiron, deckbuilding takes two factors into consideration: choice of Avatar and then choice of Apostles. Which Avatar you choose to use will be the most important decision that will define your Combat Deck's capabilities, which you can then refine and reinforce with certain Apostles. Let's theorycraft some combinations that might work well together.&#x20;

Please note that the Skill names on this page are a work-in-progress.&#x20;

### Deck #1 - Way of Water

**Avatar Planet Type**: Leviathan — Crushing Blows — The Avatar deals x% increased damage to immobilized (CC'd) targets.

**Key Avatar Skill**: Nightmarish Bubble — Water Tier 2 Skill/The Wisdom — Shoots a bubble of nightmare in the target direction that deals x magic damage to the first enemy hit, fearing and slowing them by 65% for 2 seconds.

**Apostles Key Skills**:&#x20;

**Warrior** - Slamma Jamma — After 2s, the Caster flails its weapon in a cone in the target direction, dealing \[x]\(+75%ATK) physical damage to enemies hit and knocking them up for 0.5s. If any of the enemies are slowed or stunned, they take double damage instead. Damage dealt to Avatar increases to 150%.

**Dragoon** - Thar She Blows — Throws the spear in the target direction, dealing X magic damage to the first enemy hit, then pulling them towards his direction for 3 units, slowing them by 90% for 1 second.

**Berserker** - Ultimate Uppercut — Performs a vertical punch from bottom, dealing 100 physical damage to all nearby enemies and stunning and knocking them up for 1 second.

**Knight** - CHAAARGE! — Charges to the target enemy, dealing 80 physical damage and stunning for 1.5 seconds. All enemies along the way took the same amount of damage and knocked back.

**Explanation:** This deck looks to leverage Warrior's powerful "Slamma Jamma" Skill as well as our Avatar's "Crushing Blows" Boon to deal massive damage to CC'd enemies. All of our team - including our Avatar - has ways to stun or slow, making it trivial to set up for our Warrior and Avatar to dish out the pain in a massive wombo-combo. Additionally, as our team are all tanky melee types, we're looking to charge into the fray and upset enemy formations with our innate survivability.&#x20;

### Deck #2 - Blink Midrange

**Avatar Planet Type**: Delta — River Run — After casting an Avatar Skill, the Avatars next movement within a certain range executes in the form of a Blink.

**Key Avatar Skill**: Snowball of DOOM — Water Tier 1 Skill/The Fate — Throws a snowball to the target enemy, dealing \[x] physical damage. The snowball then falls near the target after 1 second, where it remains for up to 4 seconds. Upon retrieving the snowball, the Avatar summons a Snow Thrall Apostle, while also granting the Avatar a shield equivalent to 20% of the Avatar’s max HP for 3 seconds. If the snowball kills the target, it bounces back to the top of your deck.

**Apostles Key Skills**:&#x20;

**Guardian** - I’m Coming! — Dashes to the ally with the lowest HP in range, prioritizing the Avatar, and shields both for \[60]\(+20%INT) for 3s.

**Summoner** - Ready, Yeti, Go! - Summon an Ice Yeti. Enemies around the Spirit are slowed for 20%. Ice Spirit Stats Health: 220 ATK: 25 Attack Speed: 0.7 Range: 1

**Priest** - Puddle o' Healing — Creates a zone at the target location for 10s, healing all allies for \[10]\(+15% INT) HP within the area every second.

**Knight** - Tough as Nails — Hardens the armor, shielding the caster for 150DEF that lasts for 5 seconds. After the shield breaks, shields all allies for the same amount.

**Explanation**: This is more of a midrange build - which means it has a little of everything, giving it the flexibility to adapt to whatever the enemy is bringing to the table. We start with a neat synergy between our Avatar Planet Type and Key Skill - after we cast Snowball of DOOM, we can use our passive River Run to blink to wherever the snowball lands, letting us consistently summon a Snow Thrall Apostle to our side. As this may leave our Avatar exposed among enemy combatants, our Apostles play supporting roles: the Guardian and Knight both help to shield our Avatar, the Priest heals, and the Summoner - while the attention is elsewhere - makes even more summons to overwhelm our opponent!

### Deck #3 - Glass Cannon

**Avatar Planet Type**: Oasis — Lifestealing Water — The Avatar has 25% Vamp, and its basic attack ignore 25% target's DEF.

**Key Avatar Skill**: Rising Sun Slash — Fire Tier 1 Skill/The Fury — Slashes the area around the caster, dealing \[x] magic damage to enemies within, then jumps to the target location, and deals the same amount of damage to enemies hit on impact and slowing them by 60%.

**Apostles Key Skills**:&#x20;

Dragoon - Whack! — The Caster strikes its target, dealing physical damage and healing itself for 150(+50%INT) HP.

Mage - Starcaller — Calls down 10 Meteors over 5s that randomly strike over the target area, each dealing \[60]\(+50%INT) magic damage.

Shaman - Mandated Chill Out - Applies rooted, disarmed and silenced to on the caster and targeted enemy Apostle for 5s.

Bard - Encore! - When this is drawn, it transforms into a copy of random card in your hand. Cost and effect will be the same. When this is in hand, it transforms into the last card you play. Cost and effect will be the same.&#x20;

**Explanation**: This is an interesting glass cannon build - glass cannon because we're bringing a lot of potential damage, but not that much frontline. We rely on our Avatar to hold the line alongside the survivalist Dragoon, supporting themselves with their lifestealing Skills while our backline threats pump out the damage. The Dragoon is actually key to our strategy, as he can either go forward aggressively or play more defensively as the situation requires. Meanwhile, the Shaman locks down enemies for our Mage to annihilate with powerful spells. The Bard gives us utility: more of whatever we need to let the Mage do the dirty work.&#x20;
