# Dungeon Rooms

Apeiron's dungeons come with many different types of rooms. Many of these will be battle rooms, where you'll have to overcome challenging enemies to make it further. Others will offer various utilities to you to aid you in your delving. Knowing which room to choose at the right time can make all the difference between a successful run, and one that ends too soon.&#x20;

### Battles

The majority of dungeon rooms are Battle rooms. These are your bread and butter, and also vitally important to your progress, since the rooms will drop loot such as experience to level up your team, Soul Gems to spend in the Shop, and even Apostles to add to your team and Artifacts to add to your arsenal.&#x20;

### Elite Battles

Much more challenging encounters than normal battles, elite battles come with higher risks...but better rewards in the form of more experience and a higher chance to rarer Artifacts, better Apostles, and a bounty of Soul Gems. Don't be afraid to take these on! To the victor go the spoils.

### Campfires

Need a break? Head to a campfire! Here you'll be able to recover some health for your team, train up, or even bring back one of your Apostles from the dead. If you have a big battle upcoming, try to plan to hit a Campfire first.&#x20;

### Shops

Who would set up shop in a dungeon? You'd have to be insane....oh. Well, the shopkeeper might have lost her marbles, but the shop she runs is certainly well-established. Take your hard-earned Soul Gems and buy all sorts of potions and charms to give you the edge when you need it most.

### Events

Event rooms in the dungeon offer players unique situations that they encounter outside of battles. These provide challenging choices that will test the player's strategic mind and moral compass, and may or may not have unforeseen consequences...

### Boss

At the end of Depth 3, the lowest level of the dungeon, players will encounter the dungeon boss. This big baddie is fully able to take on the party all by itself, and players will need all of their wits about them to come out on top.&#x20;
