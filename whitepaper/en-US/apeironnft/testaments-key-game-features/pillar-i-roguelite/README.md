## Enter the Dungeon

The forces of Chaos have mustered to plunder the depths of the spiritual Dirac Dimension...but they're not the only ones who have come! Sent by the High Goddess Cosmos to investigate, now it's your turn to head into the dungeon to see what you can find.&#x20;

Apeiron's dungeons are procedurally generated, which means that each time you play, the layout of rooms will be different - making each dungeon "run" unique. But not only does the dungeon itself shift: you'll also be joined by new dood Apostles - heroic doods with their own special combat skills - every time you play, as well as find new Artifacts to power you up with build-around passive bonuses.&#x20;

Battles in dungeons happen using our real-time card-battling system. You'll have a combat deck from which you'll draw a randomized hand of skill cards from your Avatar and Apostles. Using their skills in combination, you'll maneuver your Avatar around the battlefield and command your doods to win the day. It's fast-paced and hectic with a lot of room for skill expression - it's fun!&#x20;
