# A New Kind of God Game

Inspired by classic god games such as Populous, Black and White, and Spore, in Apeiron the player becomes a **Godling**, a newborn divine. You'll take control of a Planet full of **doods** - cute and cuddly little creatures - and use your divine powers to summon elemental miracles, helping the doods by answering their prayers (or punishing their sins).

But Apeiron is more than just a god game - it's also a roguelite! You'll summon an **Avatar** - a powerful elemental construct - and dive into the dangerous **dungeons** of the Dirac Dimension to fight against the forces of **Chaos** using our real-time card-battling system. Our dungeons are procedurally generated, so that each time you play, you'll have a unique dungeon experience.

The Apeiron godiverse is made up of galaxies based on mythology and folklore from around the world. Players will work together to progress Apeiron's **living story**, unlocking new content on a seasonal basis through epic **Guild v Guild combat** and large-scale **Raid Boss** battles.
