Aither Entertainment is a digital entertainment platform focusing on mobile games development and IP licensing. Founded in Hong Kong in 2016, the company pools together global talents to grow fledgling brands into unique international IP franchises. Our most famous IP is Acid Rain World, which includes toys, an online novel and mobile game. Set in a post-apocalyptic alternate universe beset by acid rain and mecha robots, the universe of Acid Rain World is a timely allegory to many of the challenges we face today - war, greed and pollution. Acid Rain World: Gray Dawn is a next generation grand strategy MMO freemium mobile game featuring the largest playable map of its kind, with tens of thousands of players from across the globe striving for world domination in real time.

As the world of blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFT) continues to grow, Aither would like to take further steps into the development of NFT games. We believe that blockchain games are not limited to simply open-world or casino games, but that players can profit alongside developers while creating epic moments inside the game together.
