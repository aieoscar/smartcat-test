In Apeiron, your **Spirit Core** represents...you! Every godling has their own unique Spirit Core form. You can use your Spirit Core to walk around your **Cradle** and interact with different characters, travel to other places, or utilize some of the helpful tools that the Cradle offers to godlings.&#x20;

Spirit Cores not only represent you - the player - in the Apeiron godiverse, they also represent your Apeiron account. As you grow in power, expect your Spirit Core to similarly gain in strength.&#x20;

Finally, your Spirit Core form will be at the center of the epic Apeiron storyline. You'll meet a variety of gods - good and evil - as you make your way through the godiverse. What kind of god will you be?
