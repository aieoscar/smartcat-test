# Avatars

**Avatars** are manifestations of a Planet's power, made real through your divinity. When out in the dungeon or battling in the Arena, your Spirit Core will take control of an Avatar. You'll be able to move your Avatar directly and fire off powerful magical abilities and skills. Your Avatar is the leader of a band of faithful Apostles who will join you in combat; your Avatar's powers will either carry your team to glory or see it doomed to be lost, given that if your Avatar falls in the dungeon, it's game over.

Avatar's have two major features that determine its powers and abilities: **Planet Type** and **Class**. There are **15 Planet Types** and **3 different Classes** (The Fury, The Wisdom, and The Fate) for a total of 45 different Avatars, each with their own distinctive gameplay.

### Classes

The Fury is your classic front-lining combat class. If you want to be in the middle of the action, if you want to defend your Apostles by throwing your own body in the way, this is the class for you.&#x20;

The Wisdom is a backline caster class, slinging spells and taking names. If you want to have access to some of the most powerful magical skills in the game, the Wisdom is for you.&#x20;

The Fate is the ultimate commander, manipulating the battlefield until victory is all but assured. If you want to show your strategic mastery of advanced Apeiron combat tactics, the Fate is the class for you.&#x20;
