In Apeiron, players become godlings, newborn gods summoned by the High Goddess Cosmos to fight against the Mad God Chaos and his insidious Taint. As a godling, you'll have your own Cradle to serve as your own personal home and base from which to launch your adventures through the godiverse and Apeiron's various game modes.&#x20;

As a godling, you'll have a number of forms you can take, which will affect your gameplay. You'll also need to prepare yourself for the War against Chaos, meaning you'll need to learn about Apostles and combat.&#x20;

This section of the whitepaper will cover:&#x20;

1. The Spirit Core
2. Your Avatars
3. Apostles
4. Combat
