# Tokens

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Apeiron ecosystem is regulated by two core tokens, Apeiros and Anima. Apeiros caters to the entire ecosystem, while Anima is focused on supporting the single-player experience. Finally, we will introduce Ringularity as our key multiplayer token in the future with the release of our GvE and GvG gameplay.

You may notice Apeiros and Anima both have in-game versions. These will be purchasable, non-tradeable in-game only tokens. We wanted to do this to make sure that we abide by the rules and regulations of existing marketplaces and to guarantee that we can smoothly deliver the Apeiron experience to as many people as possible. The godiverse is, after all, welcoming to everyone.
