## Apostles and Apostle NFTs (Coming Soon in S3)&#x20;

In contrast to the eternal life led by Gods in Apeiron, Apostles are prone to aging and eventual death (very sad). Players will encounter a diverse range of Apostles, each with unique appearances, skills, IVs, and personalities. As gods, you can extend your Apostles' lifespans and even resurrect them with the use of Miracles. Yet, such processes can be rather challenging and painful.&#x20;

To avoid the inevitability of old age and death, players can transform their Apostles into Dood Angels by minting them into NFTs. Upon achieving the Dood Angel state, which is visually represented by a Halo and Wings, Apostles cease aging and attain a form of digital immortality.

However, this ascension comes with a trade-off – their growth becomes stagnant. To resume this progress, players will need to either Reforge their Apostles NFT into Planet Relic slots. This innovative life cycle of Apostles introduces unique gameplay mechanics, deepening the immersion and complexity of the Apeiron universe. Players are encouraged not just to play, but to strategically invest in the longevity and growth of their Apostles, merging gameplay with strategic foresight.
