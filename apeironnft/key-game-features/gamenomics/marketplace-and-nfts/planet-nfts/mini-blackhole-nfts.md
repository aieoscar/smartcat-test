# Mini-Blackhole NFTs

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png>)

Mini-Black Holes (mBH) are an NFT token used to pay for Celestial Conjunction. The number of mBH needed for a given Celestial Conjunction depends upon the types of Planets used and upon the Conjunction Count of each Planet. mBH can be purchased on the market or gained as a reward for active participation in our community.&#x20;
