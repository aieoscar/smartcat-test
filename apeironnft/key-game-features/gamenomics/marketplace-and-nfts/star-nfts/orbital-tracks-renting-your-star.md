For Planets to receive aging buffs and bonuses, they need to be attached to a Star NFT's Orbital Track.&#x20;

You can rent our your unused Tracks to other players so that they can age their Planets and you can earn from it - a win win!&#x20;

Star holders can manage their Tracks through our Marketplace. There are a number of tools and settings to customize how you would like to manage your asset. You can open up as many Tracks as you want for rental, set the rental duration, price, and price per day. Interested users can then simply see what Tracks are available, decide what matches their objectives and budget, and rent accordingly.&#x20;
