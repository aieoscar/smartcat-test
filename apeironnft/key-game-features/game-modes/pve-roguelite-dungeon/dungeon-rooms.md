# Dungeon Rooms

Apeiron's dungeons come with many different types of rooms.  As you progress, you'll have different types of rooms to choose from. Knowing which room to choose at the right time can make all the difference between a successful run and one that ends too soon.&#x20;

### Battles

The majority of dungeon rooms are Battle rooms. These are your bread and butter, and also vitally important to your progress, since the rooms will give experience to level up your team, Soul Gems to spend in the Shop, and even Apostles and Artifacts to power up your run.&#x20;

### Elite Battles

Much more challenging encounters than normal battles, elite battles come with higher risks...but better rewards in the form of more experience and a higher chance to snag rarer Artifacts, better Apostles, and a bounty of Soul Gems. Don't be afraid to take these on! To the victor go the spoils.

### Cradle Portals

Need a break? Jump in a Cradle Portal and head back to base camp. Give yourself a breather. You (and your doods) deserve it.&#x20;

### Shops

Who would set up shop in a dungeon? You'd have to be insane....oh. Well, the shopkeeper might have lost her marbles, but the shop she runs is certainly well-established. Take your hard-earned Soul Gems and buy all sorts of potions and charms to give you the edge when you need it most.
