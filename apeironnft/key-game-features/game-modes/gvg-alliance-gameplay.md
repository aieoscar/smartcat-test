# GvG: Alliance Gameplay

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (148).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As our community of players grows and begins to become more powerful, we will introduce GvG Guild vs Guild Alliance gameplay. Players will be able to join Alliances - formed out of Constellations of Stars - to gain access to powerful Zodiac Buffs. An Alliance will also be a social hub, groups of friends working together towards a common goal. Games are more fun when playing together!

And you'll need all the help you can get, because GvG gameplay will involve **huge, epic Avatar battles** on a scale never before seen. We'll also be adding **Raid Bosses** to the game, who will be gatekeepers to seasonal content. Guilds will be at the forefront of taking down these Raid Bosses, and upon defeating them, will organically trigger a new wave of content for everyone to enjoy.&#x20;
