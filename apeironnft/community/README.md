## Building Bonds: Discord Doods

One of our fundamental guiding philosophies is that games are built on the back of strong communities. We think back to our most memorable gaming experiences - chatting with guildmates in _World of Warcraft_, raiding in _Destiny_, or even just gathered in front of a TV playing some _Smash Bros_ - games are more fun when you can share them with others.&#x20;

Over time, our official **Discord** server has become this kind of special community: what started as a place for people to gather and ask questions about Apeiron has become something more than just a gaming server. It's become a place where people hang out, chill, and forge real, lasting relationships with each other.&#x20;

Our Discord asks the question of our players: what does it mean to be a dood?

### What's in a Dood?

Doods are not just chubby herd like creatures that roam your Planets. Doods is a lifestyle, an attitude... Being a Dood means embracing a little silliness, a little craziness, a love for food and fun with a happy go lucky attitude. It is important to be doody about the silly little things in our lives! We invite everyone to come and be doody with us<3

If you haven't already, come and join us! There's always room for another dood in the godiverse.&#x20;
