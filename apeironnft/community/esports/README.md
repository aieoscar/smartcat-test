As part of our belief in community being the bedrock of a game's longevity, we see esports and competitive play as the lifeblood that will keep our game going by bringing in new players  - when you watch a game being played to its full potential, it's inspiring!&#x20;

Even though our game is still under development, we've already held a number of competitive events. These include the first two seasons of the Apeiron Guild War - a cross-community event bringing together gaming guilds and orgs from across the space - as well as the community-run Letrina Cup.&#x20;

Moving forward, expect more and more competitive events. We're interested in hosting events to show off individual talents as well as more team and guild-oriented tournaments. And of course, we plan to hold an esports event in a real-life stadium in the future, so be on the lookout for that!&#x20;
