The 2nd Apeiron Guild Wars kicked off with the release of the Battle Demo Season 2. This time, instead of speedrunning, it was a test of endurance, with players being asked how deep they could make it into the dungeon. They were shooting for Room 539, which, needless to say, is extremely deep - then we would look at the time taken to reach this room.&#x20;

At the end of the season, the top communities with the highest number of cleared rooms were invited to a special tournament, a Boss Rush event. In teams of 3, communities went head-to-head to see how many bosses they could beat before dying. It was an action-packed event with some surprising upsets, dark horses, and secret strategies all playing a part in determining the winner...but ultimately it was once again PIF DAO that came out on top!&#x20;

PIF winning the first two Guild Wars is certainly a statement of intent. Will they continue their dominance in Season 3? We'll see!&#x20;
