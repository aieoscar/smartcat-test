The release of the Apeiron Battle Demo Season 1 in January 2023 also marked the beginning of the Apeiron Guild Wars (AGW). This was a speedrunning event hosted in the form of a limited-time leaderboard, where players competed to make it through the dungeon and beat the boss as fast as they could.&#x20;

In the end, it was the **PIF DAO** community that claimed the top spot, with an incredible Top 3 average time of just 14''08.&#x20;

Check out this amazing speedrun!&#x20;
