The Letrina Cup was a community-run tournament drawing from the top players of the Guild Wars Season 1 Leaderboard. This was a grassroots labor of love, a celebration of the best Apeiron players, and it came down in the finals to BossOppa vs USN, with USN clinching the win. He put a staggering **109** hours into the demo and came up with his own unique strategies to pave his road to victory - GG WP!&#x20;
