Our marketplace is not just a place for trading! On the Marketplace website, you can:&#x20;

* Make an official Apeiron account
* Download the latest game client
* Forge your own Battle Pass
* Check out the latest competitive Leaderboards
* ...and more!

Here's how to make your official Apeiron account:&#x20;

2. Click "Login" in the upper-right hand corner of the screen
3. Click SIGN UP&#x20;
4. Confirm your Email Address and Password
5. Register!

You now have your own official Apeiron account. This will also be the account you use to login to the game; which is to say that all your in-game progress will be saved and connected to this account.&#x20;

5. This will open the Ronin Wallet extension. Confirm you want to bind the wallet.&#x20;
6. You're good to go!&#x20;
